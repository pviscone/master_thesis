% INTRO
The Standard Model of particle physics has been very successful.
But there are problems.
They can be explained by new exotic particles.

% SEARCH
A search is presented for a new exotic particle.
Events with jets are considered.
A novel technique is used.
The search is based on Run-2 proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 13\TeV recorded with the CMS detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137.1\fbinv.

% RESULTS
Upper limits are set on the production cross section of a new exotic particle as a function of mass.
Results are compared with theoretical predictions to obtain lower limits on the mass.
At 95\% confidence level, new exotic particles are excluded for masses below X\GeV.
