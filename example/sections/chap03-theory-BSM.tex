The SM of particle physics is successful.
Fine-structure constant $\alpha=e^2/4\pi$ has been precisely calculated and measured~\cite{g-2_e_theory1,g-2_e_theory2,g-2_e_theory3,g-2_e_Cambridge1}.
In 2012, the discovery of the Higgs boson was announced by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the CERN LHC~\cite{Higgs_discovery_2012_CMS,Higgs_discovery_2012_ATLAS,Higgs_discovery_2013_CMS,Higgs_mass_2015_combined}, more than 47 years after its prediction~\cite{Higgs_theory1,Higgs_theory2}.
But there are both problems.
The following section highlights several examples of open questions in physics.
